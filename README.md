## Description
A space-themed blog where you can find topics of my interest.

- Each topic is accessed by direct clicking on it.
- Contains a search section to easily find a topic.
- Preferred themes can be marked or unmarked by directly clicking on the star next to the theme.
- By changing the sections of the board you will find different themes.
- Within the reading you can place comments or delete comments.
- Comments can be given a "like" rating.

### What was most difficult for me was...
The design in SaSS and the deployment of the application, since being my first app in React it was a challenge to figure out how to upload dynamic projects to cloud platforms.
